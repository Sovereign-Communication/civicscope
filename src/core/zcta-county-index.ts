/**
 * Which county a ZIP code is in, from a committed Census artefact.
 *
 * This is the county counterpart of `zcta-place-index.ts`, and it exists for the
 * same measured reason: a country-wide table has 33,791 rows, so resolving a
 * county per row at runtime would be 33,791 requests rather than none. The
 * mapping is baked by `tools/gen-zcta-city-mapping.mjs` from the Census Bureau's
 * own 2020 ZCTA-to-County relationship file and served from `/map/`, which
 * `public/_headers` marks immutable for a year.
 *
 * Two things this index deliberately carries that a plain ZIP-to-county lookup
 * would not:
 *
 *   1. The county GEOID, so a row can be traced to the publisher's own county
 *      table instead of stopping at a display name.
 *   2. The share of the ZCTA's land area that falls inside that county. ZCTAs do
 *      not nest inside counties: 9,790 of 33,791 straddle a boundary. Without
 *      the share, a county total built from whole-ZIP attribution looks exact
 *      when part of it belongs to a neighbour, which is the kind of silent
 *      wrongness this project's honesty floor exists to block. See
 *      `county-aggregate.ts`, which refuses to hide it.
 *
 * The artefact is dictionary-packed: each record is a 4-digit county dictionary
 * id and a 3-digit land share, and the ZIP list is delta-encoded. Measured, the
 * unpacked alternative is roughly three times the bytes for the same data.
