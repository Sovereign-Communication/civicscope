/**
 * Saved comparisons, held in this browser.
 *
 * A saved search here is a named set of ZIP codes — the same thing a shared URL
 * carries, kept locally instead of sent to someone. It is deliberately nothing
 * more than that: no sort, no preset, no filter bounds, because a saved search
 * that remembered how you had ordered the table would be a ranking waiting to be
 * replayed, and this application does not choose orderings for anyone.
 *
 * Like the URL codec it mirrors (`src/core/url-state.ts`), every input is
 * validated: names are trimmed and capped, ZIP codes must be five digits,
 * duplicates collapse, and the count of entries is bounded so a storage key
 * cannot grow without limit. The list is capped rather than silently evicted,
 * and `save` reports refusal so the interface can say the drawer is full instead
 * of quietly dropping the oldest thing the reader kept.
