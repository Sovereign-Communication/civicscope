/**
 * Core plugin contract.
 *
 * Design rules that keep this system from collapsing as plugins are added:
 *
 *  1. A plugin DECLARES its geography and dependencies. It does not hand-write
 *     fetch waterfalls. The DAG executor resolves the graph, dedupes shared
 *     requests, and fans out concurrently. Adding source #20 must not require
 *     touching the engine or any other plugin.
 *
 *  2. `source` is MANDATORY metadata, not a comment. The methodology page and
 *     the data dictionary are generated from the registry, so documentation
 *     cannot drift out of sync with reality.
 *
 *  3. `legal` is enforced centrally by the engine. Suppression thresholds,
 *     protected-class handling, and notice requirements cannot be forgotten
 *     inside an individual plugin.
 *
 *  4. Nothing here may be personalized. No per-user credit, income, family
 *     status, or protected-class inference. Metrics describe PLACES.
