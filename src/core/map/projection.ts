/**
 * The map's projection and the geometry loader.
 *
 * `geoAlbersUsa` from d3-geo is used rather than a hand-rolled projection. It is
 * the standard US equal-area projection, and unlike a plain Mercator it draws
 * Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico as inset boxes instead of dragging them
 * thousands of miles off-canvas. Getting a projection subtly wrong would
 * misplace homes, and nothing else in this app would catch it, so one small
 * dependency is worth paying.
 *
 * The fit is computed here rather than with d3's `fitExtent`, for two reasons.
 * `fitExtent` returns a NaN scale in this build, which would silently blank the
 * map; and doing the arithmetic explicitly lets the fit be computed once and
 * reused, instead of re-projecting 33,791 points on every pan and zoom frame.
 *
 * The projection is fitted into a fixed internal box and then scaled to the
 * canvas. d3's `geoAlbersUsa` clips to 960x500 and exposes no `clipExtent`
 * setter, so fitting straight to a wider canvas would place points outside the
 * clip, where the projection returns null and the map draws nothing.
