/**
 * Turning 33,791 individual ZIP positions into something readable.
 *
 * Drawing one dot per ZIP works until it does not. At national zoom the whole
 * east coast is a single overlapping mass and the map is unreadable, which is
 * the same problem a proportional-symbol map has.
 *
 * A hexagonal bin solves it: ZIPs are grouped into hexagons of roughly equal
 * screen size, and each hexagon reports a statistic of the ZIPs inside it. One
 * hexagon is one position on the map, so the result scales with the viewport
 * rather than with the data.
 *
 * The statistic is the **median**, deliberately. A mean of household income
 * across a hexagon is dominated by whichever extreme ZIP happens to fall in it,
 * so zooming around the map would make the same area change value for no
 * reason. A median is stable under that.
 *
 * The count is also reported, because a hexagon covering one rural ZIP is not
 * the same claim as one covering four hundred, and a map that hides that
 * difference overstates how much the country is sampled.
