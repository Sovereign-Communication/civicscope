/**
 * ACS 5-year housing data, with two access shapes.
 *
 * Every table ID below was verified against the live Census variables API, and
 * two of the original ones were wrong in ways that would have produced
 * confidently incorrect numbers:
 *
 *   - `B25002_001E` is "Total OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS", not households. It was
 *     labelled and displayed as a household count. Correct table is `B25001`.
 *   - `B25035_001E` is "Median YEAR STRUCTURE BUILT", not median home value.
 *     Correct table is `B25077`.
 *
 * Rent burden was originally interpolated from the `B25070` distribution
 * because the burden median was assumed not to exist. It does exist:
 * `B25071_001E` is a published median, which replaces our own arithmetic with
 * the Census Bureau's figure and removes a whole class of dispute.
 *
 * Access shapes:
 *   - `sweepNational` — every ZCTA in one request, for screening and filtering
 *   - `fetchArea`    — one or more specific ZCTAs, for drilldown
 *
 * The 5-year sample is used over the 1-year deliberately: it exists for every
 * geography including tracts, and its wider margins of error are surfaced to
 * the user rather than hidden.
