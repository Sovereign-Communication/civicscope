/**
 * School district resources, from NCES EDGE school-district boundaries.
 *
 * Source: the live NCES ArcGIS GeoService for EDGE_ADMIN district boundaries,
 * reached through the Data.ed.gov catalog. Verified working: a point query
 * returns the district containing that coordinate, with per-pupil expenditure
 * (TOTTCH), student-teacher ratio (STUTERATIO), enrollment (MEMBER), school
 * count (SCH), and grade span already joined in. It sends
 * Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so it is keyless and works in the browser.
 *
 * This replaced an earlier integration against educationdata.education.gov.
 * That host is unreachable from this environment and, more importantly, is not
 * a better source: the EDGE service already carries the funding and staffing
 * figures joined to the boundary, so no second request and no name-matching
 * guess is needed.
 *
 * Two data hazards are handled explicitly, both found by querying live data:
 *
 *   1. `-2` is NCES's missing-value sentinel, not a number. It appears where a
 *      district is real but reports no figure.
 *   2. A point can fall inside a *supervisory union* (LEA_TYPE 3) rather than a
 *      school district — all of New York City is inside "NYC Chancellor's
 *      Office", a state-level administrative entity with no students. Returning
 *      it as "the school district" would show a user real but meaningless
 *      numbers, so those are rejected and reported honestly.
 *
 * This reports funding and staffing inputs. It does not invent a school
 * quality rating.
