 * crude prevalences with published 95% confidence intervals. The intervals are
 * wide — frequently plus or minus 8 to 15 percentage points on a single tract
 * — which is precisely why they are surfaced to the user rather than dropped.
 * A bare "37.3% obesity" would be a misrepresentation of what the data can
 * support.
 *
 * Tract geography is resolved from TIGERweb, which also needs no key. Verified
 * live: a PLACES query by tract GEOID returns data with no credential at all.
 * A health figure for the wrong geography would be worse than no figure, so
 * rather than guessing a boundary we depend on real tract resolution and
 * report unavailability when it is missing.
