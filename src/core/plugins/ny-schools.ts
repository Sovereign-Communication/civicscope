/**
 * Source: the New York State Education Department's school-level dataset.
 *
 * Verified live: `data.ny.gov` responds with a 308 redirect to
 * `data.cityofnewyork.us`, which is where the data actually lives. A browser
 * follows the redirect automatically, but the Content-Security-Policy is checked
 * against the *redirected* origin, so a browser blocked the request and the
 * plugin returned nothing. The final origin is therefore used directly, and
 * both are on the allowlist.
 *
 * It is a Socrata portal, so it returns
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, needs no key, and carries per-school
 * enrolment, grade span, graduation and attendance rates plus latitude and
 * longitude, so schools can be selected by proximity to an address.
 *
 * The honest caveat, and it is not small: `graduation_rate` here is a fraction,
 * and it is blank for schools that serve no graduating cohort — elementary and
 * middle schools, and schools too small to report. A blank means "not
 * applicable", not "poor", and the UI says so rather than showing a zero.
 *
 * This is one state's data. Every other state publishes its own assessment
 * results in a different format, and each will be added as its own plugin. The
 * `StateSchoolPlugin` interface below is what those will implement.
