/**
 * Similarity between ZIP codes, computed by the reader's own weights.
 *
 * Five positions this module takes, all of them recorded decisions rather than
 * defaults:
 *
 * **It ships off.** No visitor sees a ranking unless they turn this on, because
 * "the ZIP codes most like yours" is inherently a ranking — an earlier draft of
 * this feature's plan claimed "user agency eliminates steering risk", which is not
 * true: letting a reader choose weights changes who picks the ranking function,
 * not whether the output ranks. Making it opt-in is what actually changes the
 * default position. The flag lives in localStorage, next to the Census key.
 *
 * **The reader sets every weight.** There are no operator-chosen defaults standing
 * in for a preference, and no outcome-named templates — a template that names the
 * outcome a reader should want is the highest-steering surface in the plan, and
 * there is no attorney review to clear it later.
 *
 * **The weights draw from the sortable allowlist.** `src/core/sortable-surface.ts`
 * is the same allowlist the sort columns and the figure filters draw from, and it
 * is the mechanism that keeps protected-class metrics out: a weight key is typed as
 * an allowlisted metric, a test asserts the set, and `src/core/scoring.ts` refuses
 * such metrics from composites besides. CDC PLACES health measures are flagged
 * `protectedClassProxy` and cannot appear here.
 *
 * **The output is alphabetical, never by score.** Showing "the closest N" is
 * itself a ranking even when displayed A-Z, so the distance cut-off is visible and
 * reader-adjustable and the count says how many matched. What alphabetical order
 * guarantees is that the tool is not choosing which of the matching areas to put
 * in front of you.
 *
 * **Distance is measured against the loaded country's actual range, and only
 * between areas that carry all the compared figures.** Both of these rules came
 * from a reader's report on 2026-10-09 that a Puerto Rico ZIP showed as "distance
 * 0.04" from a Hawaii ZIP. Two defects produced that number, and the record
 * deserves both:
 *
 *  - The first version normalized each figure against the affordability index's
 *    *scoring floors*, clamped at both ends. Any value below a floor clamped to
 *    the same point as any other, so two areas with genuinely different cheap
 *    incomes — $20,000 and $27,000 — normalized to *identical* coordinates, and
 *    the distance between them read as zero. Below the floor, difference
 *    vanished. Normalization is now the loaded screen's own observed minimum and
 *    maximum for each figure, so every real difference counts at its true share
 *    of the country's range.
 *  - A missing figure was skipped and the weights renormalized over what
 *    remained. That sounds careful and is the opposite: an area sharing ONE
 *    figure with the origin — with a small difference on that single dimension —
 *    scored *better* than an area sharing all four with modest differences,
 *    because renormalizing one small difference beat averaging four real ones.
 *    Sparse areas won by default. The comment defending the rule claimed it
 *    stopped exactly the failure it caused. An area that does not publish all
 *    the compared figures is now excluded, and the panel says so.
 *
 * The whole computation is local. The country-wide screen is already in memory when
 * this runs, so comparing one ZIP against all 33,791 costs no request and needs no
 * baked payload — the plan's original design baked 0.5-1 MB of figures into the
 * bundle, five to ten times the entire application, for data the visitor already
 * holds.
