/**
 * The drilldown data, audited the same way the country-wide screen was.
 *
 * The national screen is verified cell by cell against Census: 168,860 figures
 * and 168,860 margins, zero defects. The drilldown sources — NCES school
 * districts, New York per-school, CDC PLACES — were only ever checked for
 * *shape*, which cannot tell a right number from a plausible one. This closes
 * that gap: it queries each source independently, through the app's own
 * functions, and compares every figure against what the publisher returns.
 *
 * Every source is queried a bounded number of times and the coordinates come
 * from the real national list, so this respects the same rate limits the app
 * does rather than hammering anything to produce a report.
