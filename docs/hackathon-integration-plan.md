# Hackathon integration plan

Status: **plan filed, awaiting oversight conformance read.** No slice has started.
Owner of the plan: lane/submission. Written 2026-11-05.

This is the inventory and sequencing order for bringing capabilities from the
submitted production lineage into this tool. It exists because the contest port
in `docs/contest-port-manifest.md` was a *cut*: it carried the housing core and
left the conversational, map, and durability layers behind. The gap is measured
below rather than described.

## 1. What was read, and how

| Claim | Read method | Timestamp |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lineage tree contents | `git -C musehackathon ls-tree -r --name-only 9403faa`, both clones | 2026-11-05T12:37Z |
| This repo's tree | `git ls-files` at `da989b0` | 2026-11-05T12:37Z |
| The 236-file delta | `comm -13 <(tool files) <(lineage files)` | 2026-11-05T12:37Z |
| Module sizes quoted below | `git show 9403faa:<path> \| wc -l` | 2026-11-05T12:40Z |
| Data asset size | `git cat-file -s 9403faa:public/map/zcta-counties.json` = 339935 | 2026-11-05T12:44Z |
| Lineage deploy shape | `git show 9403faa:wrangler.toml`, `git show 9403faa:package.json` | 2026-11-05T12:44Z |

Reading the lineage was done **out of the git object store**, never from a
working tree, so nothing in `C:\Users\SCM\Documents\Entire` was modified,
checked out, or executed.

**Lineage identity: `c3f4609` does not exist.** `git cat-file -t c3f4609` fails
in both `musehackathon` and `musehackathon-submit`; `git log --all` across 374
commits has no such object; and both remotes' `main` reads `9403faa` (read:
`git for-each-ref` + `cat-file`, 2026-11-05T12:38Z). The inventory below is
therefore written against **`9403faa`**, the commit that both clones actually
serve as main. See assumption A1 — this is a blocker on the *identity* of the
lineage, not on the inventory, and oversight should confirm which commit was
meant.

## 2. Fence compliance

The lineage carries three things that must not enter this repo, and the plan
routes around each rather than porting and then removing:

- `src/core/config/shared-app-key.ts` — a shared Census application key.
  **Not transferable.** The tool keeps the bring-your-own-key model that the
  completion gate grades under "the free Census rate limit is respected".
- `src/core/ai/meta-key.ts` / `src/core/ai/meta-client.ts` are already present
  *here*, and are the current coupling this work has to reduce. Every AI row
  below lands behind `src/core/ai/provider.ts`, never against a named vendor.
- `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` (the lineage's Jev transport reads it in
  `src/server/jev-client.ts`). **The transport interface may land; no key, no
  default, no fallback key.** An unconfigured judge degrades honestly and the
  deterministic layers still run.

`.entire/`, `.agents/hooks.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, `.opencode/plugins/` and
`packs/` are agent tooling, not product. They are listed as row X1 and are not
part of any slice unless the owner says otherwise.

## 3. Inventory

Proof evidence is the lineage's own proof surface quoted at the path given. It
is evidence that the capability exists and was exercised *there*; it is not
evidence that it works *here* until the slice's own run says so. Nothing in
this table was executed from the lineage in this session.

| ID | Capability | Lineage evidence | This repo today | Adaptation | Slice |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I1 | ZIP to county index | `src/core/zcta-county-index.ts` (201 lines), `src/core/zcta-county-index.test.ts`, `public/map/zcta-counties.json` (339935 B, dictionary-packed) | Absent: `zcta-place-index` exists, no county counterpart | Regenerate the artefact with the generator this repo **already has** (`tools/gen-zcta-city-mapping.mjs` emits it); never copy the blob | S1 |
| I2 | County aggregation | `src/core/county-aggregate.ts`, `src/core/county-aggregate.test.ts` | Absent | Straight port; consumes I1 | S1 |
| I3 | Result map | `src/core/map/result-geometry.ts` (335), `result-scale.ts`, `session-map.ts`, `gate-map.ts`, `src/core/map/result-geometry.test.ts`, `result-scale.test.ts`, `src/live/result-geometry.test.ts`, `src/e2e/result-map.e2e.ts` | Partial: `binning`, `centroids`, `projection`, `scale` only — no result map | Port with the probe-corrected TIGERweb query the module's own header records; the e2e is the acceptance proof | S2 |
| I4 | Deterministic arithmetic check | `src/core/ai/arithmetic-check.ts` (160) | Absent | Straight port. Needs no model and no network, so it runs even when every provider is down | S3 |
| I5 | National placeless screen | `src/core/ai/national-screen.ts` (432) | Absent | Port; the screen is deterministic, so the golden corpus is untouched | S3 |
| I6 | Voice input core | `src/core/ai/mic.ts` | Absent (the `transcribe` route is present without it) | Port the pure logic: consent state, transcript assessment, spoken-number validation | S3 |
| I7 | Jev grounding loop | `src/core/ai/jev-loop.ts` (237), `src/core/ai/jev-judgments.ts` (611), `src/server/jev-client.ts` (96), `functions/api/muse/jev.ts`, `verify.ts`, `plan.ts` | Absent: `validator` and `harness` exist, no iterative verify-and-patch loop | Transport behind a judge seam; optional provider; no key bundled | S4 |
| I8 | Meter persistence and Durable Object | `src/core/ai/meter-persistence.ts` (633), `functions/api/muse/meter-do.ts` (536), `wrangler.toml` METER binding | `src/core/ai/meter.ts` only — per-isolate, in memory | **Deployment-shape change**: needs the worker bundle (`tools/build-worker.mjs`, `tools/worker-entry.ts`) and a second script for the DO. The lineage's own `wrangler.toml` records that Pages refuses `migrations` and demands `script_name` | S5, gated on owner approval |
| I9 | General and flexible answer lanes | `functions/api/muse/general.ts`, `flexible.ts`, `src/core/ai/general.ts`, `flexible.ts`, `geography-gate.ts` (1075) | Absent | Largest port. Lands after I4 and I7 so the deterministic and grounding layers already exist underneath | S6 |
| I10 | Conversational plumbing | `bookends.ts`, `hourglass-packets.ts`, `decision-branches.ts`, `run-progress.ts`, `onboarding.ts`, `area-mention.ts`, `near-frame.ts`, `nearby.ts`, `explain-view.ts`, `intent-url.ts`, `usage.ts`, `census-key.ts` | Absent | Land each with the slice that first needs it, not as a block | with S4/S6 |
| I11 | Security middleware | `functions/_middleware.ts` | Superseded: this repo ships `public/_headers` | **Evaluated, not transferred.** Two mechanisms for one job; adopting both would let them disagree | none |
| I12 | Map-outline cure | commit `c3f4609`: `src/ui/map/ResultMap.tsx` (+115) and `tests/ai/result-map.test.tsx` (+107), subject "map outline cure: draw the referenced state's outline under the result choropleth" — parent `9403faa`, one commit, two files | Absent: the cure was the final portal-side commit and never flowed back, which is why this mirror and the GitHub copy top at `9403faa` | Port with I3 in S2; source = owner-side sync from the portal lineage (the commit exists only there and in the oversight clone) | S2 |
| X1 | Agent toolchain | `.entire/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`, `packs/`, `skills-lock.json` | Absent | Out of product scope; owner decision, not lane work | none |
| X2 | Static assets | `public/og-image.png`, `public/favicon.svg`, `map-zoomed.png` | Not carried | Transfer only if a slice actually references them | none |

## 4. Slices, smallest first

Each slice lands on `lane/submission` through this PR's gates, and each is
verified against this tool's own surfaces — the ported test plus the e2e or live
suite that exercises it here. A slice that cannot pass all three gates stops and
files a steering request rather than widening.

- **S1 — ZIP to county (I1, I2).** Self-contained data join, no provider, no UI
  change beyond a county row. Smallest possible proof that the pipeline works:
  regenerate, test, gate.
- **S2 — Result map (I3).** Independent of the AI layer. Its e2e is the
  acceptance criterion.
- **S3 — Deterministic lanes (I4, I5, I6).** No model, no network. This is the
  slice most likely to raise the gate's semantic score honestly, because it adds
  capability the evidence record can point at.
- **S4 — Grounding (I7, with the I10 modules it needs).** Provider-optional.
- **S5 — Durability (I8).** Blocked on the deployment-shape decision; see A4.
- **S6 — Conversational lanes (I9, remaining I10).** Last because it depends on
  everything above.

## 5. Assumption register

Overdue rows are blockers. A row is closed only by the method named in it.

| # | Assumption | Owner | Verify by | Method | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | `c3f4609` is the final production commit | oversight | 2026-11-06 | `git cat-file -t` in both clones + remote `main` read | **CLOSED** 2026-11-06 on oversight's read: the object is real, parent `9403faa`, one commit touching two files; it is absent from this mirror because it never flowed back, so the measurement basis was short by exactly that cure. Its content is row I12. |
| A2 | The lineage's tests pass at `9403faa` | lane | per slice | Run the ported test in this repo, not there | OPEN |
| A3 | `civicscope.pages.dev` serves this tool repo, not the lineage | lane | 2026-11-06 | Primary read of the served bundle's contents | OPEN |
| A4 | Durable-object metering needs a deployment-shape change the owner has not approved | owner | before S5 | Re-read this project's Pages config, not the lineage's | OPEN |
| A5 | No key from the portal's environment reaches this repo | lane | every push | `tools/secret-scan.mjs` in the gate + review of every diff | standing |

## 6. What is not claimed

No slice is landed. No capability here is asserted to work in this repo. The
counts above are file and line reads of the lineage at `9403faa` plus the single
`c3f4609` delta recorded as I12, and the "this repo today" column is a file-set
comparison at `da989b0`, not a behavioural review of each module. The gate's red
last measured before the instrument repair was semantic 62.8/100 against a
threshold of 99 (CircleCI pipeline 6); the repair commit scores the fourteen
clause verdicts instead of one holistic answer and is tracked on the PR.
