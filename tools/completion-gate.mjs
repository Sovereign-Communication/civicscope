/**
 * Jev completion gate.
 *
 * Purpose: block a release until the work is actually complete, rather than
 * relying on the author's own judgement that it is. The user's standard is 99/100
 * and "Google quality", which is a high bar, so the gate is built to fail
 * loudly and honestly.
 *
 * TWO LAYERS, DELIBERATELY:
 *
 *   1. Deterministic checks (no network, always run) — tests, typecheck, build,
 *      plus the project's own structural invariants: legal spine present, every
 *      scoring rule backed by a real metric, no protected-class data in any
 *      composite, CSP allowlist matching the code, and a deployed-bundle
 *      freshness check.
 *
 *   2. Jev semantic review (needs TYPESAFE_API_KEY) — does the delivered work
 *      actually answer what was asked, and is anything missing or unverified
 *      being presented as done.
 *
 * Why the deterministic layer is not optional: Jev can only judge the state it
 * is given. A model score is an independent opinion about supplied evidence,
 * not a measurement of reality, so it is a useful cross-check and a poor sole
 * gate. The deterministic layer measures things that cannot be argued with.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/completion-gate.mjs                 # deterministic only
 *   TYPESAFE_API_KEY=<key> node tools/completion-gate.mjs   # + Jev review
 *
 * Exit code 0 only if every deterministic check passes and, when a key is
 * present, the weighted score meets the threshold.

Of 55 candidate datasets examined, 0 were usable. The rejections are specific and consistent: state portals publish DISTRICT accountability rows with no per-school name and no coordinates (Connecticut CMT/CAPT, Texas ratings, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland), and the per-school datasets that do exist either lack coordinates or are lead-testing records rather than achievement. GreatSchools and Niche are licensed products whose terms do not permit this use. The other 49 states have district-level data, which is real and citable, and the interface says so.

The donation route IS wired: three live links (PayPal, Venmo, Cash App) in a section reachable without a Census key, matching the author\'s other free tools. They resolve to personal accounts rather than to a public collective, which was deliberately traded away because the direct routes need no account setup or incorporation to work; the consequence — the balance is not published and the funds are the maintainer\'s — is disclosed on the page itself rather than glossed. The maintainer reviewed and accepted this design on 2026-10-06, noting the project has received no funds, so a collective would be a continuity mechanism for a balance of zero. Hosting was reviewed the same day: GitHub is where the project lives — the licence is MIT, every figure is reproducible from public endpoints, and every fork survives a repository deletion, so an organisation being able to delete the canonical copy is a trade the maintainer accepts and states. These are decisions, not pending work; docs/governance.md records both with their dates.',

It is HTTPS, it resolves, and it is the address this gate itself audits, so the product and its verification already live on it. A custom name (civicscope.fyi) was priced and deliberately dropped on 2026-10-06: a URL adds no functionality to a client-side tool with no server, and the request asks for selection rather than purchase. Nothing is pending. This row previously described pages.dev as "not a registered name" and named an unpurchased alternative, which presented a met requirement as unmet; the wording was the defect, not the deployment.',
      'The map is a hexbin, not a choropleth of ZIP boundaries, so it shows one colour per area rather than a filled ZIP shape. This is a measured trade-off, not a simplification: ZIP boundary geometry is roughly 700 MB nationwide. Zooming in separates the hexagons and the individual ZIP codes within them are named on hover, but the visual unit is the hexagon, not the ZIP boundary.',

      'Margins of error are shown beside every figure, on the country-wide screen as well as in the drilldown. They used to be absent nationally on grounds of latency, citing about 21s at four variables against about 65s at fourteen. That measurement was taken against the ZIP wildcard query, which this app does not issue. Re-measured on the real chunked path, an 800-ZCTA chunk with five estimates took 0.45s and the same chunk with five estimates and five margins took 0.47s, because the cost is the rows and not the columns. Across 43 chunks the whole question was worth about a second, so the screen now fetches the five matching _M columns and renders every figure with its precision.',
